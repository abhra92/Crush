   - Users are presented with a playful question: *"Do you love me? 🤗"*
   - Options: "Yes" or "No".

2. **GIF Integration:**
   - Each page displays a fun GIF to reflect the interaction's tone.

3. **Interactive 'No' Button:**
   - On the last "No" page, the "No" button moves randomly when hovered over, adding an amusing challenge.
